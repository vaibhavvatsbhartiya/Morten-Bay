Coding a simple HTML form and styling to match the website

Here is your task
In this task, you will create the volunteer landing page and form using CSS and HTML to get the desired output. Included below is a zip file containing an HTML file (index.html) and a CSS file (css/main.css). Both the HTML file and the CSS file contain code that assists with the basic layout and structure of the respective documents. Unless otherwise specified in the steps below this code does not need to be changed to complete the task.

To further assist you with the task we recommend downloading an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDEs are very helpful when writing and editing code as they have been built to understand the specific syntaxes and workflows associated with working in different programming languages. If you do not already have an IDE installed a great free option is Visual Studio Code, which is an IDE created by Microsoft. You can download and install a copy of this software from the following website https://code.visualstudio.com/. 

You will be able to preview your work by double clicking the HTML file contained within the zip file. This should open a web browser, like Google Chrome, with the HTML and CSS files loaded. Although this is the simplest approach there is a better way. Web pages are served through web servers so to ensure we see the same thing in the production and development environments we should set up a development web server on our local machine. This is a common task when setting up your environment so there are a lot of options to choose from. If you have Visual Studio Code you can install an extension called Live Preview that integrates a webserver directly into the IDE. To install this, click on the extensions tab, search for Live Preview by Microsoft and click the install button. Details of how to use the extension will be included within the extension’s description.

Follow these steps to complete the task: 

1. Download and unzip the attached file.
3. Open the folder created after unzipping the file within your favorite IDE e.g. Visual Studio Code. If you are not using an IDE open the index.html file and the main.css file within a text editor like notepad.
3. Run the index.html file through your local webserver. Or double click the index.html file within your file browser (not in the IDE). Both options should open a web browser with the HTML and CSS files loaded. You should see a page that looks like the following:
4. Update the CSS file to no   longer display the Header and Footer of the HTML page.
5. Update the Title of the page to have the following copy: 
a. Save the Bay – Volunteer Page
6. Update the description of the page to have the following copy:
a. Please complete the form below to register your interest in becoming a volunteer with Save the Bay.
7. Create a form in the placeholder provided. The form should have 4 elements: (Note: HTML Forms usually have actions associated with them, however, this is not required for the task).
   a. An input tag that is of type text and has a label with a value First name:
   b. An input tag that is of type text and has a label with a value Last name:
   c. A select tag that has four options: General, Food & Drinks, Security and Medical. This tag should have a label with a value Volunteer group:
   d. An input tag with type submit and value Submit
8. Update the CSS file to style the form with the following attributes:
   a. The form should have a width of 100%.
   b. The font-family for all text within the form should be sans-serif.
   c. The font-size of all text in the form should be 1rem.
   d. All input tags and select tags should have the same width and height. Note, select tags have different paddings associated with them that make this a little difficult. If you are struggling, try using the browsers dev tools and always remember that google is your friend.
   e. Apply a blue background colour to the submit input tag and colour the text white.
9. Once you have completed the task zip up the folder containing your HTML and CSS files and upload it to the Forage site. Your final product should look something like this:
